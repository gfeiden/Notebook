### AGB star companions (2015-08-06)

A previous idea was that PCEB stars may be preferentially metal-rich after accreting material ejected by the primary star. In particular, the existence of KOI-XXX and the case of CM Dra, which appears at the metal-rich tail of the distribution for thick disk stars. White dwarf companion suggests an AGB tertiary once existed, perhaps CM Dra stars accreted material and are now metal rich?

Now, there was a tweet from M. Collins about a talk given by Starkenberg, 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starkenburg: Carbon enhanced stars canâ€™t all be aGB stars, because see them all over CMD. Could be AGB companions? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAUS317?src=hash">#IAUS317</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAU2015?src=hash">#IAU2015</a></p>&mdash; Michelle Collins (@michelle_lmc) <a href="https://twitter.com/michelle_lmc/status/629377540684148736">August 6, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This makes me wonder whether one should perform rough calculations of accreted matter by an AGB star companion as a function of stellar mass (i.e., spectral type). Since stellar mass of the companion would affect its orbital distance and velocity, there could be a sweet spot for detecting metal-rich companions to post-AGB stars or WDs. Many might appear single, given the difficulty of detecting the primary at great distances.

### Pore Formation (2015-08-05)

Upwelling convective flows divert magnetic flux toward intergranule lanes. Intergranule lanes are already sites of cooler material. Could reduce the need for material trapped in flux concentrations to shed excess heat.

### M Dwarf Knee as Distance Indicator (2015-07-31)

$(B-V)$ color-magnitude diagrams exhibit a knee as TiO becomes a strong absorber in the optical. For near-solar metallicity clusters, this knee may occur at a fixed luminosity/magnitude, making the location of the knee a strong distance indicator. Quantifying precisely where the knee begins would need to be worked out and which part of the knee is least sensitive to modeling errors. Models could help fix the metallicity dependence of the knee's magnitude.

### Convective Core Overshoot in M Dwarfs (2015-02-06)

Before becoming partially convective (or fully convective), many M Dwarfs possess a convective core, radiative shell, and convective outer envelope. How strong of core overshoot might we expect in M Dwarfs? Would it have an effect on the evolution of the star? Overshoot in M dwarfs was mentioned briefly in van Saders & Pinsonneault (2012) in their work on the $^3$He instability. They suggest it is likely not an important factor, but that it should probably be checked. Primary problem is that CCO is typically treated as extra mixing, and not a means of modifying the temperature gradient.

### Magnetic Inhibition of Convection in Convective Cores (2015-01-27)

Investigate the influence of dynamo generated magnetic fields on the properties of stars with convective cores. Despite [theoretical evidence](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...705.1000F) that strong fields may exist in the cores of higher mass stars (A and F type), no work has been done to see how the fields may effect the evolution of those stars. Convection is typically (near-)adiabatic in cores. Perhaps near the interface region?
