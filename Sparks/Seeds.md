### M Dwarf Knee as Distance Indicator (2015-07-31)

$(B-V)$ color-magnitude diagrams exhibit a knee as TiO becomes a strong absorber in the optical. For near-solar metallicity clusters, this knee may occur at a fixed luminosity/magnitude, making the location of the knee a strong distance indicator. Quantifying precisely where the knee begins would need to be worked out and which part of the knee is least sensitive to modeling errors. Models could help fix the metallicity dependence of the knee's magnitude.

### Convective Core Overshoot in M Dwarfs (2015-02-06)

Before becoming partially convective (or fully convective), many M Dwarfs possess a convective core, radiative shell, and convective outer envelope. How strong of core overshoot might we expect in M Dwarfs? Would it have an effect on the evolution of the star? Overshoot in M dwarfs was mentioned briefly in van Saders & Pinsonneault (2012) in their work on the $^3$He instability. They suggest it is likely not an important factor, but that it should probably be checked. Primary problem is that CCO is typically treated as extra mixing, and not a means of modifying the temperature gradient.

### Magnetic Inhibition of Convection in Convective Cores (2015-01-27)

Investigate the influence of dynamo generated magnetic fields on the properties of stars with convective cores. Despite [theoretical evidence](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...705.1000F) that strong fields may exist in the cores of higher mass stars (A and F type), no work has been done to see how the fields may effect the evolution of those stars. Convection is typically (near-)adiabatic in cores. Perhaps near the interface region?
