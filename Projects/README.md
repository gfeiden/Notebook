# Project Collection

Well developed ideas or lines of thought. Each sub-collection in the greater Project Collection contains notes and data related to a specific paper. Notes within the individual sub-collections will hopefully, one day, emerge as a paper. When this occurs, all notes and data may be directed towards a separate repository to permit others to download individual papers instead of my entire notebook, the latter would be horrendously cumbersome if one only cared about a given paper. 

For the moment, papers and projects that have previously been published will not be made available, at least immediately. This is due more to time restrictions. However, as I find free moments, I do hope to populate this collections with notes from past projects. 

One idea of note: projects that require some semblence of secrecy, whether it be a blind study or the use of proprietary data, may be left out until conditions are suitable for their appearance. While this is counter to the goals of having an open research notebook, having details of a study available to participants in a blind study, for example, is rather counter to the aims of the project.
