    "### Early Stellar Evolution and the Role of Magnetic Fields\n",

    "Absolute stellar ages are some of the most sought after astrophysical quantities, especially for identifiably young systems, which provide our only constraints on time-dependent features of planet formation and evolution. However, accurate ages for young stars remain elusive due to our reliance on stellar evolution models that are beset with problems at ages younger than 100 Myr. I will highlight the most pressing issues facing young stellar models along with efforts to explain these problems by considering effects that strong magnetic fields may have on the interior structure and observable properties of young stars. To support this explanation, I will present several lines of evidence, including recent work rectifying multiple age discrepancies noted for the 10 Myr old Upper Scorpius OB Association. I will conclude with a discussion of uncertainties in our current understanding about how magnetic fields influence early stellar evolution and new efforts to relieve them."

    "\n",
    "Absolute ages estimated for identifiably young stellar populations strongly depend on which stars are used in the age dating analysis. Cooler K- and M-type stars typically yield ages that are systematically younger by a factor of two compared to warmer A-, F-, and G-type stars. In this talk, I will highlight efforts to understand these age discordancies as the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young stars. Specifically, I will focus on the adoption of magnetic stellar evolution models to derive a consistent 10 Myr age for the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. Multiple pieces of evidence in support of this explanation will be presented along with several remaining problems and uncertainties. "

    "A majority of stars in the Galaxy are low-mass main-sequence stars. These stars are actively fusing hydrogen in their core and have an outer convection zone. Convection is an important physical process that regulates the transport of energy within low-mass stars, controlling the whole of a star's interior structure and many of a star's observable properties. Briefly, I will review the basic physics of stellar convection along with a simple phenomenological description used in stellar interior structure models. Under the simplified model of convection, convective properties are typically assumed to be qualitatively similar to properties of convection in the Sun within some scaling factor. I'll present results from ongoing investigations that leverage high precision data and statistical inference to provide empirical constraints on the properties of convection in other stars within the framework of stellar structure models. Particular attention will be given to the statistical techniques and the robustness of the results."

    "__Abstract__\n",
    "\n",
    "Young low-mass stars often exhibit signatures of temperature anisotropies on their surface. These starspots are thought to be magnetic in origin and therefore analogous to sunspots. Despite the apparent prevalence of magnetic fields and starspots on young stars, little is known about the role these phenomena play in governing stellar structure and evolution. Briefly, I will review our current understanding about the formation of sunspots and, by analogy, starspots. I will then present results of efforts to understand the influence of starspots on stellar structure and evolution. Finally, I will highlight potential implications for inferred ages of young stellar systems. "

    "Young low-mass stars appear to all possess strong magnetic fields, as evidenced by high levels of magnetic activity in the form of starspots, as well as chromospheric and coronal emission. Despite their omnipresence, magnetic fields are routinely neglected in stellar interior structure and evolution models, threatening to compromise the accuracy of stellar model predictions and erode our confidence in ages derived for young stellar populations. In this talk, I will highlight efforts designed to understand whether magnetic fields and/or starspots are actively altering the interior structure of young low-mass stars and how these effects may bias young stellar ages."

    "Stellar evolution models are a cornerstone of young star astrophysics, which necessitates that they yield accurate and reliable predictions of stellar properties. In this talk, I will review basic ingredients in standard stellar evolution models and the performance of standard models against young astrophysical benchmarks. I will then highlight recent progress incorporating new physics in modern stellar models, such as magnetic fields, starspots, and accretion, invoked to explain observed deficiencies. While addition of these physical processes leads to improved agreement between models and observations, I will demonstrate that there are fundamental limitations in our understanding of how these physical processes operate, inhibiting our ability to form a coherent picture of the essential physics needed to accurately compute young stellar models."

    "Low-mass stellar evolution models are a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, particularly with the rise of asteroseismology and the search for extrasolar planets. It is therefore critical that stellar models provide accurate predictions of fundamental stellar properties (radius, effective temperature, luminosity). However, there is strong evidence suggesting that stellar evolution models are unable to predict the properties of low-mass stars. In this talk, I will discuss current problems faced by low-mass stellar models and the consequences of leaving these problems unresolved. I will also highlight results from studies aimed at revealing the source of disagreements between models and observations including: rotation, chemical composition, and magnetic fields."
