    "A majority of stars in the Galaxy are low-mass main-sequence stars, or stars whose outer layers are unstable against convection whilst they are fusing hydrogen in their core. Convection is an important physical process, particularly in near surface layers, governing the observable properties of a star and influencing the whole of a star's interior structure. Briefly, I will review the basic physics of stellar convection and motivate the need for simple phenomenological descriptions. I will then present results from ongoing investigations that explore the properties of convection in low-mass stars, guided by predictions from stellar interior structure models that adopt simple descriptions of convection. There is a growing consensus that convection must become progressively less efficient with decreasing surface temperature and increasing surface gravity, at odds with predictions from detailed radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Motivated by these results, I propose several explanations for the origin of the observed correlations, focusing primarily on the viability of magnetism as a leading candidate. However, magnetic effects are highly dependent on spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the discussion will be broadly split between the influence of global and local magnetic field concentrations on stellar structure and evolution over several timescales. \n",

    "The surface of Sun is characterized by a granulation pattern that is the visible manifestation of convection occuring in the solar photospheric layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is convection like on other stars? Do the fundamental properties of convection vary from star to star? Are they dependent on a star's specific properties, such as its mass, composition, or average surface temperature? Finally, how do the properties of convection affect a star's evolutionary history and are there other complications about which we ought to be concerned?\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex 3D simulations are used to probe these simulations, but are unable to evaluate the influence convection has on a star's evolutionary history."

    "### Magnetic Fields, Starspots, and the Interior Structure of Young Low-Mass Stars\n",

    "Young low-mass stars appear to all possess strong magnetic fields, as evidenced by high levels of magnetic activity in the form of starspots, as well as chromospheric and coronal emission. Despite their omnipresence, magnetic fields are routinely neglected in stellar interior structure and evolution models, threatening to compromise the accuracy of stellar model predictions and erode our confidence in ages derived for young stellar populations. In this talk, I will highlight efforts designed to understand whether magnetic fields and/or starspots are actively altering the interior structure of young low-mass stars and how these effects may bias young stellar ages."

    "Stellar evolution models are a cornerstone of young star astrophysics, which necessitates that they yield accurate and reliable predictions of stellar properties. In this talk, I will review basic ingredients in standard stellar evolution models and the performance of standard models against young astrophysical benchmarks. I will then highlight recent progress incorporating new physics in modern stellar models, such as magnetic fields, starspots, and accretion, invoked to explain observed deficiencies. While addition of these physical processes leads to improved agreement between models and observations, I will demonstrate that there are fundamental limitations in our understanding of how these physical processes operate, inhibiting our ability to form a coherent picture of the essential physics needed to accurately compute young stellar models."

    "Low-mass stellar evolution models are a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, particularly with the rise of asteroseismology and the search for extrasolar planets. It is therefore critical that stellar models provide accurate predictions of fundamental stellar properties (radius, effective temperature, luminosity). However, there is strong evidence suggesting that stellar evolution models are unable to predict the properties of low-mass stars. In this talk, I will discuss current problems faced by low-mass stellar models and the consequences of leaving these problems unresolved. I will also highlight results from studies aimed at revealing the source of disagreements between models and observations including: rotation, chemical composition, and magnetic fields."
