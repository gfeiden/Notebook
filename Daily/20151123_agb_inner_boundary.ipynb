    "# RHD Model Atmosphere Inner Boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the properties of RHD model atmosphere inner boundaries for AGB stars. Liljegren finds that some models fail to converge due to a temperature instability. Temperatures at the inner boundary increase rapidly before finally reaching a temperature that is outside of the pre-computed opacity grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question becomes, is the temperature instability the result of missing physics near the inner boundary? We suspect that the lack of a description of convection for the inner layers of the atmosphere model are causing a false build-up of heat, leading to the runaway temperature instability. To explore whether this is the case, we'll need to first take a look at the thermodynamic state of the gas in the envelope.\n",

    "RHD models adopted by Liljegren are based on the RHD model atmosphere developed by HÃ¶fner et al. ([2003, A&A, 399, 589](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...399..589H)). For simplicity, and to allow for better comparison with previous studies, the RHD models adopt a perfect gas equation of state with $\\gamma = 5/3$ and $\\mu = 1.26$. The mean molecular weight is that for a non-interacting (i.e., perfect) gas without consideration of ionization states, which effectively equates the mean molecular weight with the mean atomic molecular weight.\n",

    "Liljegren provided the following properties of the gas near the inner boundary prior to the temperature instability: $P_{\\rm gas} = 1680\\ {\\rm Ba}$ with $T = 5600\\ {\\rm K}$. Using the perfect gas equation of state, one can derive a density for the gas\n",
