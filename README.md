# Research Notebook

Contained within the directory structure of this repository (since 2015-07-22) is my research notebook. You can think of it as an all-access pass to my work and ideas.

## Purpose, or a cautionary tale.

The purpose of this notebook is to facilitate my research. While the content within may (hopefully) one day prove educational or inspiring, it is, first and foremost, for my own benefit. Notes may contain snippets of thoughts, meant only as a reminder for a future me or they may contain well developed texts complete with citations and quantitative analyses. At the same time, you may also find projects seemingly abandoned in the middle of their development, lying in purgatory of the mind; progressed beyond the initial spark of excitement, awaiting their fate of slowly fading from memory or making a triumphant return to glory after another more insightful spark. There is also a strong possibility that notes and analyses contain mistakes, either innocent or grave. 

## Structure

Each directory contains notes and analyses that pertain to a particular category of my work. Readable files will be written in either [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (specifically, [GitHub flavored](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)) or a combination of embedded Python and Markdown in the form of [IPython/Jupyter notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). 

Categories are:

* Daily: random thoughts, ideas, essays, and analyses.

* Dev: idea purgatory. Analyses that aren't developed enough to be considered projects.

* LitRev: my review of papers in the academic literature (mostly).

* Projects: works in progress that will result in a submitted manuscript.

* Sparks: ideas that might be interesting to investigate further.

## Collaboration

If I am lucky, one day the words and analyses contained within this notebook will have an influence on someone's work. Perhaps the day is now and that someone is you? If so, you are of course free to develop any ideas further. Of course, credit is always welcome, whether it be through an acknowledgement, a personal message, or an invitation to collaborate. 

Note that there is no means of direct citation, yet. Soon enough I will make the notebook citeable through Zenodo. 

## Criticism

Chances are that you disagree with something that I have written or an analysis I have performed. Great! Feel free to [contact me](mailto:gregory.a.feiden@gmail.com?subject=Notebook Disagreement) or [create an issue](https://github.com/gfeiden/Notebook/issues/new) to open a topic for discussion.
