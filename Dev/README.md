# Development Collection

Although it may sound like my signature clothing line, this collection contains notes related to developing projects. That is to say, hypotheses and ideas I am exploring, but which are not yet fully developed to result in something publishable. In fact, many notes probably contain very little aside from a random thought. As individual ideas develop further, they may graduate to the Projects collection. In that case, a summary and link to the Project notebook will be provided within the Development note.
